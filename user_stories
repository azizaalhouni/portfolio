## Day One
As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive with a menu, so that I can get around using any device.

## Day two

As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings swiftly.

##Day 3

- As a reader, I want to click the "Read On" button so that I can see the entire article.
- As an author, I want my articles filtered by name so that readers can find all my posts.
- As the creator, I want the About nav to act as a tab, so my story is revealed FAST.

#Day 4
1- As a developer, I want to use Handlebars for my project template, so that I can include new projects more easily.
2- As a developer, I want my CSS styles to follow SMACSS organization, so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.
3- s a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.
- Set up your h1, h2, h3 elements according to a type scale.
- Include some good fonts, that work well together.

##Day 6
-As a developer, I want to store my project data in a .json file, so that I can keep it organized.
- As a developer, I want to retrieve that source data file asynchronously, so that my app logic gets the data just when I need it.

##Day 7
- Eliminate all for loops.

- Use map where you are transforming one collection into another.

- In at least one place, enclose the contents of a script file in an IIFE, that exports your high-level objects.

- Refactor any parts of your app that could be more loosely coupled. Make smaller functions that can accept and expect the return values of other functions!

- Think of a useful way to use reduce. Maybe you want to put some "fun facts stats" in your footer?

##Day 11
- Update your main nav so that each clickable item is a link to a different url,
 that is handled by a function as indicated by page.js.
