## Day One
As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive with a menu, so that I can get around using any device.

## Day two

As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings swiftly.
